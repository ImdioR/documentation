### Anchor 1

This is a sub-subpage

### Anchor 2

This is a sub-subpage

Method:

1. understand difference in TOC structure between subpages and anchors
2. find out how to split anchors in to separate category to display on right side of screen
3. create right side anchor display for anchors of current route

TOC will always contain anchors on the page
Subpages will appear as nodes with their own anchors and will have more slashes in the slug
