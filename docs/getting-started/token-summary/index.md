# Temp

The Centrifuge Token (CFG) powers Centrifuge, facilitating an onchain governance system that empowers CFG holders to steer Centrifugeâ€™s evolution without reliance on a centralized third party. CFG is also used to pay for transactions on Centrifuge Chain.

Centrifuge can also be bridged 1:1 to Ethereum, where it can be used with decentralized applications.

All changes to the Centrifuge protocol or the CFG token model described here go through governance proposals and need to be implemented by CFG token holders.

## Governance
CFG tokens are utilized  for the ability to participate in technical governance in proportion to their stake in the protocol by voting to upgrade the chain runtime code. CFG holders participate in governance through an onchain voting mechanism on proposals: runtime upgrade proposals are voted on by the token holders. Approved proposals are enacted programmatically onchain.

## CFG Token Distribution
### Initial Distribution
The initial CFG Generation Event was executed by the Centrifuge Network Foundation. The initial distribution created 400,000,000 CFG, which was distributed to the Foundation and initial contributors, including; the core team, investors, and validators. Since genesis, additional tokens have been minted as rewards for chain security and to incentivize adoption. This wide token distribution is core to the decentralization of Centrifuge.

### Token Lockups
Token lockups help to align incentives of the token holder to the long-term growth of the Centrifuge ecosystem.

Most CFG tokens have long-term lockups at their distribution. Core team members have 48 month lockups when they join, with a 12-month cliff. Generally CFG sales are also subject to long-term lockups. Rewards may also be subject to lockups.
