## Why bring finance onchain?

Financing real-world assets requires many intermediaries to function right now. The shortlist of parties involved in a bond issuance [includes](https://twitter.com/rayesalexander/status/1501270049952178176) a lead manager, managers, lawyers, paying agents, fiscal agents, auditors, registrars, transfer agents, calculation agents, listing agents, rating agents, process agents. All of these intermediaries add to the upfront and ongoing costs, increasing the barriers for small and medium enterprises compared to large corporations.

**Onchain finance allows multiple parties to achieve agreement on shared information without a trusted intermediary**. With Centrifuge, the reliance on the intermediaries mentioned above can be greatly reduced, leading to a more open, transparent and efficient access to finance.

That's the big idea behind what we're building. But what are the other advantages of onchain finance?

**Tokenization brings more efficiency and lower costs**. The low marginal costs reflect the power of automation and blockchain enabled efficiencies, which contrasts the high labor and operational costs of traditional financial methods.

**Centrifuge combines tokenization infrastructure with an institutional ecosystem** to create an onchain credit platform that unlocks unparalleled efficiency and growth. The many service providers involved in a traditional securitization add much more in annual fees versus secrutizing onchain. Centrifuge removes unnecessary intermediaries to redistribute value to key stakeholders.

**Securitization on new rails.** Centrifuge enables high-quality assets and investment structures, institutional participants with high standards, and an onchain native portfolio with pools available to investors wherever they exist.

**Asset Tokenization unlocks previously illiquid markets**. A large chunk of the world's wealth today is locked in illiquid assets or asset classes only accessible to limited institutions due to opaque nature and market structure.

**More than just tokenization.** Centrifuge is the comprehensive platform to take the initial benefits of tokenization into a powerful, automated technology for more accessibility, liquidity and interoperability of digital assets. Users can access onchain capital markets on a global scale. Developers can build cohesive, customized infrastructure solutions via blockchain primitatives too integrate and expand asset management functionality.

## A short history of Centrifuge

Centrifuge was founded in 2018 to bring real-world assets onchain. At the time, decentralized finance was a very young concept. Alongside other now-standard protocols like Uniswap and Aave, we launched our first iteration of Centrifuge, called Tinlake, in 2019. Tinlake ran on Ethereum and implemented multi-tranche, revolving pools â€” a first for onchain finance.

Centrifuge has experimented with multiple versions of the previous iteration of the Centrifuge Protocol, called [Tinlake](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/), on Ethereum. It started with the first version in 2019, adding static pooling and simple tranching support in early 2020, launching the revolving pools late 2020, and integrating the first real-world asset pool with the MakerDAO protocol in mid 2021. The lessons learned from these iterations have been used to develop the first version of the full fledged Centrifuge Protocol. Every iteration has been thoroughly audited by [acknowledged smart-contract auditing firms](https://github.com/centrifuge/security/tree/main/audits).
