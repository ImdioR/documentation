## Why are we building Centrifuge?

In traditional finance, asset financing requires many intermediaries to function. For example, the shortlist of parties involved in a bond issuance can include a lead manager, managers, lawyers, paying agents, fiscal agents, auditors, registrars, transfer agents, calculation agents, listing agents, rating agents, process agents.

All of these intermediaries add to the upfront and ongoing costs, increasing the barriers for small and medium enterprises compared to large corporations.

With Centrifuge, the reliance on the intermediaries mentioned above can be greatly reduced, leading to a more open, transparent and efficient access to finance. **Onchain finance allows multiple parties to achieve agreement on shared information without a trusted intermediary**. 

Representing real-world assets onchain is known as **tokenization**. Tokenization brings more efficiency and lower costs — these lower costs reflect the power of automation and blockchain-enabled effiencies, in contrast to the high labor and operational costs of traditional finance. 

Looking ahead: we're building Centrifuge to be a comprehensive platform to take these initial benefits of tokenization and build powerful, automated infrastructure for accessibility, liquidity, and interoperability of digital assets. Users will be able to access onchain capital markets on a global scale, and developers will be able to build cohesive, customized financial infrastructure tailored to their specific use cases.

## The history of Centrifuge

### The early years: Pioneering RWA
Centrifuge was founded in 2018 with the mission to bring real-world finance onchain. The first iteration of our platform, built on Ethereum, was called [Tinlake](https://legacy.tinlake.centrifuge.io/). With Tinlake, we pioneered multiple tranches and revolving pools — firsts for onchain finance. 

### MakerDAO and Aave integrations
In mid-2021, [Centrifuge integrated the first real-world asset pool with MakerDAO](https://medium.com/centrifuge/defi-2-0-first-real-world-loan-is-financed-on-maker-fbe24675428f). This marks both the first loan to use MakerDAO as a credit facility as well as the first instance of a stablecoin (DAI) being backed by real-world assets.

Later in 2021, we launched the [RWA Market](https://medium.com/centrifuge/rwa-market-the-aave-market-for-real-world-assets-goes-live-48976b984dde), making use of the Aave protocol to bring liquidity to RWAs on Centrifuge. 

### Bringing the first credit fund onchain
In 2022, BlockTower Credit became the [first institutional credit fund to bring their collateralized lending operations onchain](https://centrifuge.mirror.xyz/yGWnk8ar_iXuoML-ZKF79NfKa9Q43o5SKgu13qR4uIg) by funding $220M of real-world assets through Centrifuge — with MakerDAO providing $150M of senior capital to the BlockTower's Centrifuge pools. This was the largest onchain investment in real-world assets to date.

### Centrifuge brings RWAs to protocols and DAOs
In mid-2023, we launched [Centrifuge Prime](https://centrifuge.mirror.xyz/KyrMWLKMccFCNfSlvjxe7uyhba7oLrUzlBuZ7GQTn6s): our product that helps DeFi-native organizations, like DAOs, stablecoins, and protocols, onboard and scale a portfolio of real-world assets.

### RWA Summit
### TAC
### Credit Group

### Pools on Centrifuge Chain go live
Later in 2023, Centrifuge launched its first pool on Centrifuge Chain. Centrifuge Chain is a purpose-built, upgradeable blockchain purpose-built for real-world finance. Compared to legacy pools on Tinlake, pools on Centrifuge Chain offer much lower transaction fees, and we can build institutional-ready features like new loan types and 3+ tranche-pools — capabilities that are not easy, or even impossible, to scale on a smart-contract based chain like Ethereum.

### Cross-chain expansion to EVM chains
Alongside launching pools on Centrifuge Chain in late-2023, Centrifuge also released Liquidity Pools: 

Centrifuge was founded in 2018 to bring real-world assets onchain. At the time, decentralized finance was a very young concept. Alongside other now-standard protocols like Uniswap and Aave, we launched our first iteration of Centrifuge, called Tinlake, in 2019. Tinlake ran on Ethereum and implemented multi-tranche, revolving pools — a first for onchain finance.

Centrifuge has experimented with multiple versions of the previous iteration of the Centrifuge Protocol, called [Tinlake](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/), on Ethereum. It started with the first version in 2019, adding static pooling and simple tranching support in early 2020, launching the revolving pools late 2020, and integrating the first real-world asset pool with the MakerDAO protocol in mid 2021. The lessons learned from these iterations have been used to develop the first version of the full fledged Centrifuge Protocol. Every iteration has been thoroughly audited by [acknowledged smart-contract auditing firms](https://github.com/centrifuge/security/tree/main/audits).
