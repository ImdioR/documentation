## Temp

Centrifuge is the platform for onchain finance, enabling the decentralized financing of real-world assets (RWAs) and providing a fully transparent market which allows borrowers and lenders to transact without unnecessary intermediaries.

Asset pools are fully collateralized, investors have legal recourse, and the protocol is asset-class agnostic with pools for assets spanning real estate, US treasuries, carbon credits, and consumer finance.

Centrifuge's ecosystem extends beyond its onchain financial infrastructure, incorporating a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) supported by a diverse community of finance professionals and developers.

By bringing the entire structured credit market onchain across securitization, tokenization, privacy, governance, and liquidity integrations, Centrifuge is building a more transparent, affordable, and limitless financial system.
