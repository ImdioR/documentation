# Welcome to Centrifuge

Centrifuge is the platform for onchain finance, enabling the decentralized financing of real-world assets (RWAs) and providing a fully transparent market which allows borrowers and lenders to transact without unnecessary intermediaries.

Asset pools are fully collateralized, investors have legal recourse, and the protocol is asset-class agnostic with pools for assets spanning real estate, US treasuries, carbon credits, and consumer finance.

Centrifuge's ecosystem extends beyond its onchain financial infrastructure, incorporating a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) supported by a diverse community of finance professionals and developers.

By bringing the entire structured credit market onchain across securitization, tokenization, privacy, governance, and liquidity integrations, Centrifuge is building a more transparent, affordable, and limitless financial system.


maybe this area is a quick links area? like direct people to
- products
- DAO
- Mission / good reading
- Resources and links
- User documentation
- Developer documentation

but is this a user friendly way? maybe more directive

## Why are we building Centrifuge?

The key property of onchain finance is that it enables multiple parties to achieve agreement on shared information without a trusted intermediary. Financing real world assets requires many intermediaries to function right now, e.g. the shortlist of parties involved in a bond issuance [includes](https://twitter.com/rayesalexander/status/1501270049952178176) a lead manager, managers, lawyers, paying agents, fiscal agents, auditors, registrars, transfer agents, calculation agents, listing agents, rating agents, process agents. All of these intermediaries add to the upfront and ongoing costs, increasing the barriers for small and medium enterprises compared to large corporations.

Centrifuge brings credit onchain to solve this problem. If the financing process is coded into a blockchain, the reliance on these intermediaries can be greatly reduced, leading to a more open, transparent and efficient access to finance. Centrifuge does exactly this by combining the Centrifuge Protocol, the trustless consensus layer for real world asset transactions with a real-word framework that links the onchain to offchain transactions.

**Asset Tokenization unlocks previously illiquid markets**. A large chunk of the world's weatlh today is locked in illiquid assets or asset classes only accessible to limited institutions due to opaque nature and market structure.

**Tokenization creates more efficiency and lower costs**. The low marginal costs reflect the power of automation and blockchain enabled efficiencies, which contrasts with the high share of labor and operational cost of traditional financial institutions.

**Centrifuge combines tokenization infrastructure with an institutional ecosystem** to create an onchain credit platform that unlocks unparalleled efficiency and growth. There are 14 service providers involved in a traditional securitization, adding >1% in annual fees. Centrifuge removes unnecessary intermediaries to redistribute value to key stakeholders.

**Securitization on new rails.** Centrifuge enables high-quality assets and investment structures, institutional participants with high standards, and an onchain native portfolio with pools available to investors wherever they exist.

**More than just tokenization.** Centrifuge is the comprehensive platform to take the initial benefits of tokenization into a powerful, automated technology for more accessibility, liquidity and interoperability of digital assets. Users can access onchain capital markets on a global scale. Developers can build cohesive, customized infrastructure solutions via blockchain primitatives too integrate and expand asset management functionality.

### A short history of Centrifuge

Centrifuge has experimented with multiple versions of the previous iteration of the Centrifuge Protocol, called [Tinlake](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/), on Ethereum. It started with the first version in 2019, adding static pooling and simple tranching support in early 2020, launching the revolving pools late 2020, and integrating the first real-world asset pool with the MakerDAO protocol in mid 2021. The lessons learned from these iterations have been used to develop the first version of the full fledged Centrifuge Protocol. Every iteration has been thoroughly audited by [acknowledged smart-contract auditing firms](https://github.com/centrifuge/security/tree/main/audits).
