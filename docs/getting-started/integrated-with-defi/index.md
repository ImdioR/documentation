## Connectors
Investors arenâ€™t just users with wallets but also DeFi (decentralized finance) lending protocols, stablecoins or even DEXs. These users are distributed across many different chains. The easier we can make it for both users and protocols to invest in Centrifuge assets, the more liquidity can be accessed by issuers on Centrifuge.

To facilitate this, Centrifuge will build Connectors: smart contracts that live on any other chain and interact with the Centrifuge Chain over existing bridges, allowing investors to interact from these chains without ever touching the Centrifuge Chain.

## Liquidity integrations
Using Connectors as the bridging technology, integrations are used to enable protocols to invest in real world assets. Stablecoin protocols such as MakerDAO can invest directly into the pools that they want, money markets can be created to provide portfolio diversification to individual investors, and  secondary markets for the tokens could be created in the future.
