## Connect your wallet 

When using Centrifuge you can choose between deployed pools on Centrifuge Chain and pools on Ethereum. You can connect to both chains via our wallet component that allows you to pick the wallet of your choice. To do so, click on `Connect` in the top right corner. Then, first select the chain you want to connect with (currently Ethereum and Centrifuge)

In the second step select the wallet of your choice. On Centrifuge the system currently supports [Talisman](https://www.talisman.xyz/), [Subwallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/subwallet-polkadot-extens/onhogfjeacnfoofkfgppdlbmlmnplgbn) and [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).

![](./images/wallet-component-cf.png#width=40%;)

On Ethereum, the system supports [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html), [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) and multiple other wallets through [Wallet Connect](https://walletconnect.com/).

## Set up Ethereum wallet (Metamask)
### What is MetaMask?
MetaMask is a browser extension that allows you to use Ethereum protocols or dApps (decentralized Apps) such as Tinlake. The extension holds your private keys and serves as a wallet for ETH and ERC20 tokens, such as DAI, senior token of pool, or junior token of pool. Connect MetaMask to the app and confirm your transactions to transfer and receive tokens.

### How to install MetaMask in your browser
1. Go to https://metamask.io/download.html.
2. Choose the browser you want to use.
3. You will be directed to corresponding web store.
4. Follow the steps there to add the extension to your browser.
5. After setting up your wallet, Metamask should pop-up as a fox icon in your browser bar.

### Connect MetaMask with Centrifuge
- Click on the Connect button in the top right corner.
- Choose the MetaMask wallet in the wallet dialog.

## Set up a hardware wallet for Ethereum (Ledger)
### What is a hardware wallet?
A hardware wallet stores the user's private keys in a secure hardware device. To use an address stored in a hardware wallet a user needs to be in physical possession of the device. A popular hardware wallet is [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/).

### Setting up a Ledger device
Download the [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/) and follow the steps in the app described [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018784134).

### Install Ethereum app on Ledger device
Set up first Ledger Ethereum (ETH) account. See more [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009576554-Ethereum-ETH-).
1. Open the "Manager" in Ledger Live.
2. Connect and unlock your device.
3. If asked, allow the manager on your device.
4. Find Ethereum in the app catalog.
5. Click the Install button of the app.
    - An installation window appears
    - Your device will display `Processing...`
    - The app installation is confirmed

### Configure Ethereum app 

1. Open the app *Settings*.
2. Change *Contract Data* to `Yes`.
3. [OPTIONAL] For older versions of Ledger, make sure *Browser Support* is set to `Yes`. Newer Ledger Versions are supporting it by default. 

### Connect hardware wallet in MetaMask
1. Open MetaMask by clicking on the fox icon.
2. Make sure to select the correct network (`Main Ethereum Network` or `Kovan Test Network`) at the top.
3. Click on the circle in the top right corner.
4. Click on `Connect Hardware Wallet`.
5. A new modal opens. Select `Ledger` and click `Connect`.
6. Select the address you would like to use. Ledger already offers several autogenerated addresses to choose from.

### Confirm transactions with your hardware wallet (Ledger)
When your MetaMask account is connected to the hardware wallet you need to confirm each transaction with Ledger.

**Note that Ledger hardware wallets currently do not support Centrifuge Chain (CFG)**

## Set up a CFG wallet

### Overview
You can create a CFG account in any wallet that supports Polkadot. For detailed information on how to set up Polkadot accounts using the different tools that Web3 Foundation/Parity developed and supports, please also see this [article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000098878-how-to-create-a-dot-account). This tutorial will cover:

- Talisman
- Polkadot.js browser extension 
- Parity Signer (now called Polkadot Vault)

### Using Talisman
Talisman is a wallet that supports Substrate (Polkadot) and Ethereum accounts. The Talisman wallet browser extension is available on Google Chrome, Brave, and Firefox, and a corresponding asset dashboard is accessible at [app.talisman.xyz](https://app.talisman.xyz/portfolio)

1. Download the extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talisman-polkadot-wallet/fijngjgcjhjmmpcmkeiomlglpeiijkld/related) and install it
2. Create a wallet using the instructions from Talisman [here](https://docs.talisman.xyz/talisman/navigating-the-paraverse/account-management/create-a-talisman-wallet)
3. Back up your wallet using the the instructions from Talisman [here](https://docs.talisman.xyz/talisman/navigating-the-paraverse/account-management/back-up-your-secret-phrase) (**THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT**)

To see your CFG wallet address, click on "Receive" under your account and select CFG (Centrifuge) from the list.

### Using the Polkadot.js extension

Polkadot.js browser extension allows you to manage your accounts (rename, change network, export etc.). The browser extension is available on Google Chrome and Firefox, and you can use [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fcentrifuge-parachain.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/accounts) to see your balance, transfer tokens, participate in governance etc.

1. Download the extension [here](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) and install it
2. Create a new account by clicking on "+" in the top right of the extension and selecting "Create new account"
3. Save your recovery phrase in a safe place before you continue (**THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT**)
4. Set NETWORK to "Centrifuge Chain" and give your account a name and password

![](./images/set-up-polkadotjs.png#width=400)

5. Once created, backup the account by selecting the 3 dots to the right of the account name and clicking "Export Account"
6. Make sure you save the downloaded JSON file in a safe place, and remember the password for this account

![](./images/export-account-json.png#width=400)

You can always recover your account in either of two ways:

* Importing the account by using your seed phrase
* Importing your account by using the JSON file + the password to your account

### Using the Parity Signer App

This is an unofficial guide on how to use the Parity Signer App to create an account on Centrifuge Chain. Please consult the official Parity Signer documentation [here](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer).

1. Buy an old or new device (ex. iPod touch, Android phone, etc.)
     - **Important:** only charge it with a battery bank or wall charger, **donâ€™t plug it into a computer!!!** Use a charge only cable, not a data cable.
2. Set up a passcode and set it to wipe the device upon entering the code incorrectly too many times.
3. Install the [Parity Signer App](https://www.parity.io/signer/) from below links:
     - [Link for Apple device](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/parity-signer/id1218174838)
     - [Link for Android device](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.parity.signer)
4. Never connect the the device to a computer, even to upgrade it.
5. Turn off WiFi & Bluetooth (**NEVER TURN IT ON AGAIN!**)
6. Create a key for Centrifuge Mainnet using the Parity Signer App
     - Create your identity to get started

       ![](./images/new-identity.png#width=400)
     - Write down your 24 word Recovery Phrase (**THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT**)

       ![](./images/recovery-phrase.png#width=400)
     - Set your Identity PIN
       - **You will use this PIN to sign all of your transactions using this device.**
     - Create your first Keypair - select the Centrifuge Mainnet Network
       ![](./images/create-keypair.png#width=400)
7. Get your address by scanning the QR code on the Polkadot.js website.
     - On your computer, navigate to https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer
     - Make sure the network is set to Centrifuge.
     - Click on Accounts
     - Click on 'Add via QR'
       ![](./images/add-via-qr.png#width=400)
     - Scan the QR code on your device for your Centrifuge Mainnet Public Address
       ![](./images/public-address-qr.png#width=400)
     - Your address for Centrifuge Mainnet should begin with a '4...'
1. To manually check the above process:
     - Delete the key from the app
     - Recover the key from your backed up phrase
     - Verify the address matches what you obtained above

1) Send some test CFG to another address and use Parity Signer to sign this transaction
     - You will first need to send some CFG to this account
     - Initiate a transfer on the Polkadot.js website by selecting 'Transfer' in the left menu or on 'Send' from the Accounts page
     - Click 'Make Transfer'
     - Click 'Sign via QR'
     - Using the Parity Signer App, scan the QR code in your browser with the App's QR Scanner from this account screen (see above on how to get it).
     - In the app, confirm your signature of the transaction by entering your PIN
     - Click 'Scan Signature QR' in the browser
     - Sign the transaction

1) Backup your Recovery Phrase and keep it somewhere safe. Please do research on secure methods for storage and recovery.

> **A note on app updates:**
> If a new version of the app becomes available, please exercise the following caution.
> Ideally, replace the device or do not update the app.
> If an update is necessary:
>
> 1.  Hard reset the device and wipe everything
> 2.  Re-install the new parity signer app
> 3.  Turn off wifi & bluetooth and **NEVER TURN IT ON AGAIN**
> 4.  Recover your key from seed phrase

- **Remember to write down your secret phrase & STORE IT SAFELY!**
  Follow a secure protocol to save and store your private keys. Please do some research and choose a secure method that will work best for you.
