## Introduction
Investing in Tinlake pools requires onboarding as an investor and to each specific pool. Submitting your information for KYC and signing a document with the pool's issuer takes 15-30 minutes. You will be ready to invest within 24 hours.

![Steps to onboard as investor and onboard to pool](./images/onboarding_overview.png)

**Onboard as investor**: Onboarding as an investor is a one-time step to verify your profile for KYC ("Know your customer") through the Securitize service. Once onboarded as an investor you are eligible to invest in any Tinlake pool.

**Onboard to pool**: Onboarding to a pool requires signing a subscription agreement with the pool issuer. Once the agreement has been signed by both parties, you are automatically whitelisted for investment.

### Requirements
Onboarding as an investor requires:
- Ethereum wallet, e.g. Metamask
- A passport or government-issued photo ID
- Your tax number
- Proof of address (e.g. utility bill, phone bill or council tax bill, not older than 3 months)

Onboarding to a pool requires:
- Ethereum wallet
- A verified KYC in Securitize (i.e. a completed onboarding as an investor)
- A minimum investment amount of 5,000 DAI

**Good to know**: Don’t worry if you can’t finish the process in one go – you can always leave by clicking `Close` and resume later where you’ve left off before.

#### Further requirements
- **US investors** need to be *accredited investors* to invest in Tinlake pools. *See section [Onboarding as US investor](#onboarding-as-an-us-investor)*
-  Due to US sanctions, investors from **certain countries are excluded** from investing. *See section [Excluded countries](#onboarding-as-an-us-investor)*

## Onboard to pool as new investor

## FAQ
A compilation of frequently asked questions

##### What is the minimum investment amount?
The minimum investment amount is determined by the pools issuer. It currently is \$5.000 for all Tinlake pools.

##### What documents/information do I need to provide for KYC?
To complete KYC, Securitize will ask you to provide:

- Passport or government issued photo ID
- [Optionally] A selfie with this government issued photo ID
- Proof of address, e.g. a utility bill, phone bill or council tax bill, not older than 3 months

##### How long does KYC take?
Securitize's automated KYC process is usually conducted within 1–2 hours. If a manual review is required it may take 24–48 hours.

##### What happens with my data?
All investors must consent to share their personal data, such as name, address and country of residents with Securitize, Centrifuge and the pool's issuer. This data will be disclosed to Securitize during the onboarding process. Securitize may share this data with the pool's issuer and Centrifuge. *For more information see the [Data Sharing Policy](#Data-sharing-policy) below.

##### Why do I need onboarding and KYC to invest in Tinlake pools?
Tinlake pools are backed by real-world assets such as invoices, residential real-estate loans or trade receivables. Financing those assets on Tinlake requires a legal structure that give the investors a legal claim on the assets. To ensure this recourse, each Asset Originator sets up a legal structure commonly used in the traditional financial system - a “special purpose vehicle” ("SPV"). The collateral for the individual assets are assigned to this legal entity to ensure investors have a legal claim to the underlying assets and the assets are held independently ("bankruptcy remote") from the Asset Originator. 

With an underlying legal structure, investments in Tinlake Pool's are private placements from a regulatory perspective. This comes with certain regulatory requirements For example, behind many Tinlake pools are SPVs incorporated in Delaware. Private placements from these SPVs are conducted under `Reg D` or `Reg S` of the [`US Securities Act of 1933`](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1884/pdf/COMPS-1884.pdf) which means US investors must be accredited and all investors must clear standard KYC ("Know Your Customer") checks. All investors must sign a subscription agreement ("SubDoc") with the pools "Issuer", the legal SPV entity behind the pool.

This legal set-up leads to certain restrictions. For example, there is a minimum investment amount per pool, US investors have to be `Accredited Investors` and, unfortunately, investors from certain countries may be excluded due to sanctions or missing tax treaties.

This contradicts the idea of decentralized and open finance and the Centrifuge team is working hard to allow more people to invest within the legal framework given by regulators.

### Onboarding as an US investor
To invest in Tinlake as an US investor you need to be an "Accredited Investor".

#### What is an "Accredited Investor"?
An accredited investor is an individual or a business entity that is allowed to trade securities that may not be registered with financial authorities such as the SEC. They are entitled to this privileged access by satisfying certain requirements regarding their income, net worth, asset size, governance status or professional experience. In the U.S, the definition of an accredited investor is put forth by [SEC in Rule 501 of Regulation D](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=8edfd12967d69c024485029d968ee737&r=SECTION&n=17y3.0.1.1.12.0.46.176).

The regulations for accredited investors vary from between jurisdictions but require that a person:

- Must have a certain annual income [currently $200,000 ($300,000 for joint income) in the US] or
- Must have a certain net worth [currently $1 million in the US] or
- Be a general partner, executive officer, or director for the company that is issuing the unregistered securities or
- Be a registered brokers and investment advisor

Please find more information on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp).

#### What information do I need to provide as accredited investor?

If you are an US investor you further need to provide documentation to prove you are an `Accredited Investor`. These documents can be, e.g.:

- IRS documents such as 1040s, W2s, 1099s, or K1s as proof of income
- Documents proving a net worth of at least \$1MM USD excluding the primary residence value not older than 90 days
- Third party letters signed by a licensed CPA, attorney, broker-dealer or registered investment advisor
